<h1>Power App for Non Tech-Savvy Users: Transforming Business Processes</h1>

<p>Today's organizations face ever-growing challenges in terms of increasing efficiency, improving productivity, and staying ahead in the competitive market. This Power App is designed to help non tech-savvy users harness the power of technology to automate and streamline their business processes. It uses the Lean Six Sigma approach to help users manage their processes and identify areas for improvement, focusing on the DMAIC phases.</p>

<h2>How the Power App Works</h2>

<p>The Power App provides a structured approach to improving processes, incorporating six key steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Define:</b> Identify the problem from various perspectives, including the company, stakeholders, and customers. Understand the customer's quality expectations and the extent of the problem.</li>
  <li><b>Measure:</b> Analyze the current process and its contribution to the problem. Determine if the process can meet the customer's quality expectations and match each process step to the established quality criteria. Support your measurements with actual performance data.</li>
  <li><b>Analyze:</b> Use the gathered information to finalize the problem's nature, scope, and cause.</li>
  <li><b>Improve:</b> Solve the problem and verify the improvement. Collaborate to create a solution that eliminates both the problem and its cause, using data to ensure the solution fits the issue. Test the solution and collect performance data to support it.</li>
  <li><b>Automate:</b> Determine the logic throughout the process, identify parts that can be automated using available tools and concepts, and remove the human component to enhance speed, accuracy, and auditability.</li>
  <li><b>Control:</b> Monitor the improvement and continue to refine where possible. Finalize acceptable performance criteria and establish a plan to handle variations, sustain improvements, and prevent the original problem from recurring.</li>
</ol>
